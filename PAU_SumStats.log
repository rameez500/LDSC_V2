Interpreting column names as follows:
Allele2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
Allele1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
N:	Sample size
SNP_ID:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
Z:	Z-score (0 --> no effect; above 0 --> A1 is trait/risk increasing)
PValue:	p-Value

Reading sumstats from /projects/bga_lab/SHUGGETT/GWAS/Alc/PAU/PAU.txt.gz into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 10922161 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 2516292 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
8405869 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (8405869 SNPs remain).
Removed 3926223 SNPs with N < 199149.666667 (4479646 SNPs remain).
Median value of Z was 0.003, which seems sensible.
